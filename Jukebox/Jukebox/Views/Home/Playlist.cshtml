    <h1>JUKEBOX</h1>
    <p class="lead">Jukebox is a online music player that can be shared with everyone.  Users connect with others in 
                    online rooms and share, enjoy, and discover new music from one another's libraries.  These rooms 
                    will feature a playlist comprised of music from the creator's library that he/she chooses to be 
                    in the playlist and other users can enter the room and input more music of their own into the 
                    playlist if they desire.
