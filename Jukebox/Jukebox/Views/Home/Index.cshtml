            Jukebox is a online music player that can be shared with everyone.  Users connect with others in
            online rooms and share, enjoy, and discover new music from one another's libraries.  These rooms
            will feature a playlist comprised of music from the creator's library that he/she chooses to be
            in the playlist and other users can enter the room and input more music of their own into the
            playlist if they desire.
